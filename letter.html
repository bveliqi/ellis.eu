        <p>
            We are at a crossroads where

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>machine learning is at the heart of a technological and societal artificial intelligence revolution</b>
                    involving multiple sister disciplines,
                    <sup>1</sup> with large implications for the future competitiveness of Europe,
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Europe is not keeping up</b>: most of the top labs, as well as the top places to do a PhD, are located
                    in North America; moreover, AI investments in China and North America are significantly larger than in
                    Europe, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>the distinction between academic research and industrial labs is vanishing</b>, with a significant part
                    of the basic research now being done in industry (with substantial research freedom, and higher salaries),
                    rapid commercialization of results, and academic institutions worldwide struggling to retain their best
                    scientists (with negative implications not only for research but also for the education of future talent).
                    This further weakens Europe since all of the companies doing top research in this field are controlled
                    from the US (or China) – many European companies whose future business crucially depends on AI are not
                    perceived as competitive.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>There are still a few machine learning & perception research hotspots in Europe</b>
            that play in the international top league. Virtually all of the top people in those places are continuously being pursued
            for recruitment by US companies. Even if we only wanted to retain these centers, we would need to increase our
            investments in line with what other countries are doing. To strengthen our position, we need to build on what
            is strong in Europe, think big and have the courage to try new models.
            <sup>2</sup> We believe our best bet is for the outstanding centers in Europe to join forces.
        </p>
        <b>European strength currently lies in its academic culture and well-educated students.</b>
        E.g., Cambridge and Zurich have top university departments in the field, Tübingen has top Max Planck departments, and in
        France, we have a mixture of both between the Paris universities (e.g., Ecole normale supérieure) and CNRS/INRIA.
        Large US players have started research labs in those places, such as Amazon (Cambridge, Tübingen), Apple (Cambridge),
        Facebook (Paris), Google/Deepmind (Zürich, Paris, London), Microsoft (Cambridge), Qualcomm (Amsterdam). While a major
        motivation for these labs is the competition for local talent, the labs also strongly contribute to the local ecosystems
        by rendering them more attractive for students and researchers, and educating a generation of high-level professionals,
        some of who subsequently form startups.

        <p>

            <h3>PROPOSAL</h3>

            <p>
                We should found a
                <b>European Lab for Learning & Intelligent Systems</b> (working title; abbreviated as “ELLIS”), involving the
                very best European academics while working together closely with basic researchers from industry.

                <br/>

                <b>The mission of ELLIS is to benefit Europe</b> in two ways:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        we want the best basic research to be performed in Europe, to enable Europe to shape how machine learning and modern AI change
                        the world, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        we want to have economic impact and create jobs in Europe, and believe this is achieved by outstanding and free basic research,
                        independent of industry interests.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>


            <p>
                This is how to make ELLIS competitive:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Outstanding facilities</b> and computing infrastructure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is an
                        <b>inter-governmental organization</b> (like EMBL, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory). France
                        and Germany may be (the) initial partner countries, the Netherlands would be an excellent addition,
                        but ELLIS is not limited to the EU; in particular, there are outstanding centers of excellence in
                        Switzerland, the UK, and Israel, and we would benefit from including them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS comprises
                        <b>labs in the partner countries</b> at the top academic sites for machine learning & perception research.
                        This allows jump-starting ELLIS by means of (short or long term) co-affiliation and/or secondment
                        of outstanding academics. Excellent researchers across each country may be connected via fellowships,
                        and the links to local research institutions are vital for ELLIS to thrive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It runs
                        <b>programs for visiting researchers (both from academia and industry)</b>, as well as
                        <b>workshops and summer schools</b> for students, academics, and industrial participants.
                        <b>Mobility</b> is facilitated by housing, childcare, and (international) schools at each site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It aims at building a
                        <b>European PhD and MSc program</b> in cooperation with degreegranting universities. The participating
                        degree-granting institutions will allow and encourage students in their MS and PhD programs to spend
                        time in at least two ELLIS partner sites, with no additional tuition charge, and co-supervision from
                        researchers at these sites. ELLIS will provide fellowships to support this program
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        ELLIS researchers can
                        <b>split their time between ELLIS and local university or industry research labs</b> (creating an incentive
                        for industry to co-locate). Collaboration with industry is encouraged and structured using transparent
                        and simple IP rules that ensure that public funding is used in a way that benefits the public. Joint
                        research involving industry and public funding is openly publishable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS researchers can
                        <b>found startups based on IP they generate</b>. ELLIS does not aim to optimize short-term licensing
                        income, and rather aims at sustained economic impact in Europe. To this end, it owns a modest share
                        in those startups and claims no further rights as long as the startup is formed in a partner country,
                        thus generating downstream impact (including jobs) in Europe. ELLIS supports startups in terms of
                        (a) generous leave-of-absence rules, (b) temporary use of infrastructure, and (c) help with administration
                        including legal/financial advice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS does not need a large headcount for personnel initially (since it strictly only recruits top notch academics), but
                        it does need a
                        <b>long term funding commitment</b>
                        including a plan how the funding ramps up. Each local lab could aim to reach at least the scale of a major Max Planck institute,
                        i.e., around 100 Mio EUR for infrastructure and an annual budget increasing to 30 Mio EUR during
                        the first ten years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Existing funding structures are too slow:
                        <b>ELLIS should start in 2018</b> and the core of such an initiative could be formed by at least France
                        and Germany (e.g., CNRS/INRIA and Max Planck).
                        <sup>3</sup> There is interest among top researchers not only in those countries, but also in Switzerland,
                        the UK, the Netherlands, and Israel. Institutional links between some of the sites already exist
                        (joint centers and joint PhD programs).
                        <sup>4</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to researchers and faculty from the partner institutions, ELLIS will offer permanent employment to outstanding
                        individuals early on and train them in both academic and non-academic skills. These researchers will
                        receive an adjunct faculty position from one of the partner institutions. They will also be offered
                        a complete career path within ELLIS, paralleling those found in tenure-track programs, from the equivalent
                        of the rank of assistant professor to that of a full professor. This will be a major step towards
                        avoiding brain drain to the US.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS’ unique characteristic is
                        <b>outstanding academic quality</b> as measured for instance by publications in the leading competitive
                        conferences of the field.
                        <sup>5</sup> It does not preclude other national and international activities that focus mainly on applied
                        research and industry cooperation, but ELLIS’ pure mission of
                        <b>excellence in basic research
                        </b> must not be compromised.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br/>
                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>

                <p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is no shortage of funding for AI research, but
                            <b>it is extremely hard to attract outstanding researchers</b>. However, it is the quality of the
                            individual researchers that determines the strength of the overall lab, and only top people act
                            as true talent magnets. US institutions and companies have recognized that money spent on those
                            people pays off in multiple ways. In Europe, there are currently only few types of academic positions
                            that allow us to attract such top people, e.g., Max Planck directorships or full professorships
                            at ETH. Our only chance to attract such people to ELLIS is to offer positions with outstanding
                            academic freedom and visibility (in cooperation with Max Planck, ENS, CNRS, INRIA, as well as
                            participating top universities), with top packages.6
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since the field holds great economical promise, there may be competition of different sites to be home to an ELLIS lab. The
                            only criterion should be
                            <b>academic excellence</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </p>


                <br/>
                <h3>VISION</h3>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS will perform
                        <b>fundamental research in modern AI</b>, attract top international industry research labs, and spawn
                        <b>startups</b>
                        that will become major players in the future. It will thus drive excellence in Europe’s research and use of machine intelligence
                        to foster economic development and improve the lives of people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS will be a
                        <b>top employer in machine intelligence research</b>, on par with Berkeley, Stanford, CMU, and MIT.
                        It will also be a world class venue to get trained in the field: in conjunction with universities,
                        it will develop a highly attractive
                        <b>European PhD program</b>, and it will strive to retain the best graduates within ELLIS to groom them
                        into the next generation of senior scientists.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Taken together, this means
                        <b>that Europe will be able to play a major role in the scientific and societal revolution that is underway
                        </b>. The first and second industrial revolution not only transformed technology but also led to
                        fundamental societal changes. These changes were managed by European democracies and values. The
                        current revolution may be equally significant. Europe should benefit from it and European values
                        should help shape its impact.
