        <p>
            We are at a crossroads where

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>machine learning is at the heart of a technological and societal artificial intelligence revolution</b>
                    involving multiple sister disciplines,
                    <sup>1</sup> with large implications for the future competitiveness of Europe,
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Europe is not keeping up</b>: most of the top labs, as well as the top places to do a PhD, are located
                    in North America; moreover, AI investments in China and North America are significantly larger than in
                    Europe, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>the distinction between academic research and industrial labs is vanishing</b>, with a significant part
                    of the basic research now being done in industry (with substantial research freedom, and higher salaries),
                    rapid commercialization of results, and academic institutions worldwide struggling to retain their best
                    scientists (with negative implications not only for research but also for the education of future talent).
                    This further weakens Europe since all of the companies doing top research in this field are controlled
                    from the US (or China) – many European companies whose future business crucially depends on AI are not
                    perceived as competitive.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>There are still a few machine learning & perception research hotspots in Europe</b>
            that play in the international top league. Virtually all of the top people in those places are continuously being pursued
            for recruitment by US companies. Even if we only wanted to retain these centers, we would need to increase our
            investments in line with what other countries are doing. To strengthen our position, we need to build on what
            is strong in Europe, think big and have the courage to try new models.
            <sup>2</sup> We believe our best bet is for the outstanding centers in Europe to join forces.
        </p>
        <b>European strength currently lies in its academic culture and well-educated students.</b>
        E.g., Cambridge and Zurich have top university departments in the field, Tübingen has top Max Planck departments, and in
        France, we have a mixture of both between the Paris universities (e.g., Ecole normale supérieure) and CNRS/INRIA.
        Large US players have started research labs in those places, such as Amazon (Cambridge, Tübingen), Apple (Cambridge),
        Facebook (Paris), Google/Deepmind (Zürich, Paris, London), Microsoft (Cambridge), Qualcomm (Amsterdam). While a major
        motivation for these labs is the competition for local talent, the labs also strongly contribute to the local ecosystems
        by rendering them more attractive for students and researchers, and educating a generation of high-level professionals,
        some of who subsequently form startups.

        <p>

            <br/>
            <h3>PROPOSAL</h3>

            <p>
                We should found a
                <b>European Lab for Learning & Intelligent Systems</b> (working title; abbreviated as “ELLIS”), involving the
                very best European academics while working together closely with basic researchers from industry.

                <br/>

                <b>The mission of ELLIS is to benefit Europe</b> in two ways:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        we want the best basic research to be performed in Europe, to enable Europe to shape how machine learning and modern AI change
                        the world, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        we want to have economic impact and create jobs in Europe, and believe this is achieved by outstanding and free basic research,
                        independent of industry interests.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>


            <p>
                This is how to make ELLIS competitive:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Outstanding facilities</b> and computing infrastructure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is an
                        <b>inter-governmental organization</b> (like EMBL, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory). France
                        and Germany may be (the) initial partner countries, the Netherlands would be an excellent addition,
                        but ELLIS is not limited to the EU; in particular, there are outstanding centers of excellence in
                        Switzerland, the UK, and Israel, and we would benefit from including them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS comprises
                        <b>labs in the partner countries</b> at the top academic sites for machine learning & perception research.
                        This allows jump-starting ELLIS by means of (short or long term) co-affiliation and/or secondment
                        of outstanding academics. Excellent researchers across each country may be connected via fellowships,
                        and the links to local research institutions are vital for ELLIS to thrive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It runs
                        <b>programs for visiting researchers (both from academia and industry)</b>, as well as
                        <b>workshops and summer schools</b> for students, academics, and industrial participants.
                        <b>Mobility</b> is facilitated by housing, childcare, and (international) schools at each site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It aims at building a
                        <b>European PhD and MSc program</b> in cooperation with degreegranting universities. The participating
                        degree-granting institutions will allow and encourage students in their MS and PhD programs to spend
                        time in at least two ELLIS partner sites, with no additional tuition charge, and co-supervision from
                        researchers at these sites. ELLIS will provide fellowships to support this program
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        ELLIS researchers can
                        <b>split their time between ELLIS and local university or industry research labs</b> (creating an incentive
                        for industry to co-locate). Collaboration with industry is encouraged and structured using transparent
                        and simple IP rules that ensure that public funding is used in a way that benefits the public. Joint
                        research involving industry and public funding is openly publishable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS researchers can
                        <b>found startups based on IP they generate</b>. ELLIS does not aim to optimize short-term licensing
                        income, and rather aims at sustained economic impact in Europe. To this end, it owns a modest share
                        in those startups and claims no further rights as long as the startup is formed in a partner country,
                        thus generating downstream impact (including jobs) in Europe. ELLIS supports startups in terms of
                        (a) generous leave-of-absence rules, (b) temporary use of infrastructure, and (c) help with administration
                        including legal/financial advice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS does not need a large headcount for personnel initially (since it strictly only recruits top notch academics), but
                        it does need a
                        <b>long term funding commitment</b>
                        including a plan how the funding ramps up. Each local lab could aim to reach at least the scale of a major Max Planck institute,
                        i.e., around 100 Mio EUR for infrastructure and an annual budget increasing to 30 Mio EUR during
                        the first ten years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Existing funding structures are too slow:
                        <b>ELLIS should start in 2018</b> and the core of such an initiative could be formed by at least France
                        and Germany (e.g., CNRS/INRIA and Max Planck).
                        <sup>3</sup> There is interest among top researchers not only in those countries, but also in Switzerland,
                        the UK, the Netherlands, and Israel. Institutional links between some of the sites already exist
                        (joint centers and joint PhD programs).
                        <sup>4</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to researchers and faculty from the partner institutions, ELLIS will offer permanent employment to outstanding
                        individuals early on and train them in both academic and non-academic skills. These researchers will
                        receive an adjunct faculty position from one of the partner institutions. They will also be offered
                        a complete career path within ELLIS, paralleling those found in tenure-track programs, from the equivalent
                        of the rank of assistant professor to that of a full professor. This will be a major step towards
                        avoiding brain drain to the US.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ELLIS’ unique characteristic is
                        <b>outstanding academic quality</b> as measured for instance by publications in the leading competitive
                        conferences of the field.
                        <sup>5</sup> It does not preclude other national and international activities that focus mainly on applied
                        research and industry cooperation, but ELLIS’ pure mission of
                        <b>excellence in basic research
                        </b> must not be compromised.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br/>
                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>

                <p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is no shortage of funding for AI research, but
                            <b>it is extremely hard to attract outstanding researchers</b>. However, it is the quality of the
                            individual researchers that determines the strength of the overall lab, and only top people act
                            as true talent magnets. US institutions and companies have recognized that money spent on those
                            people pays off in multiple ways. In Europe, there are currently only few types of academic positions
                            that allow us to attract such top people, e.g., Max Planck directorships or full professorships
                            at ETH. Our only chance to attract such people to ELLIS is to offer positions with outstanding
                            academic freedom and visibility (in cooperation with Max Planck, ENS, CNRS, INRIA, as well as
                            participating top universities), with top packages.6
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since the field holds great economical promise, there may be competition of different sites to be home to an ELLIS lab. The
                            only criterion should be
                            <b>academic excellence</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </p>


                <br/>
                <h3>VISION</h3>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            ELLIS will perform
                            <b>fundamental research in modern AI</b>, attract top international industry research labs, and
                            spawn
                            <b>startups</b>
                            that will become major players in the future. It will thus drive excellence in Europe’s research and use of machine intelligence
                            to foster economic development and improve the lives of people.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ELLIS will be a
                            <b>top employer in machine intelligence research</b>, on par with Berkeley, Stanford, CMU, and MIT.
                            It will also be a world class venue to get trained in the field: in conjunction with universities,
                            it will develop a highly attractive
                            <b>European PhD program</b>, and it will strive to retain the best graduates within ELLIS to groom
                            them into the next generation of senior scientists.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Taken together, this means
                            <b>that Europe will be able to play a major role in the scientific and societal revolution that
                                is underway
                            </b>. The first and second industrial revolution not only transformed technology but also led
                            to fundamental societal changes. These changes were managed by European democracies and values.
                            The current revolution may be equally significant. Europe should benefit from it and European
                            values should help shape its impact.
                        </li>

                <h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>

                <p>

                    In the time since publishing the ELLIS open letter, we have received a large number of messages, most of which strongly support
                    the idea of establishing ELLIS. We below address some questions that came up across the board:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>How can I support ELLIS?</b>
                            <br/> First of all, feel free to speak up: talk to the press in your country, talk to decision makers
                            in your country, and tweet or blog about ELLIS. You may also provide us with quotations that
                            we can use, or send us a letter of endorsement. At a later stage, we will seek donations and
                            industry sponsorship.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>How can we become an ELLIS site and/or how can my country become part of ELLIS?</b>
                            <br/> Our plan is that each partner country provides their ELLIS facilities/infrastructure. Prerequisite
                            for participating in ELLIS are long-term guarantees for the below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    subscribing to ELLIS' overall philosophy, i.e., open basic research benefitting the public good, adoption of ELLIS governance
                                    and excellence standards
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    outstanding lab/office space, provided free of charge (incl. for ELLIS visitors)
                                </li>

                            Partner countries may choose to embed ELLIS facilities into larger infrastructures including researchers employed by local/national
                            institutions, as long as such arrangements are deemed mutually beneficial. These researchers
                            will usually be recruited nationally, however, all ELLIS recruitments are done solely by ELLIS
                            to ensure a uniform bar of excellence across all of ELLIS (see below).

                            <b>How can I join an ELLIS lab?</b>
                            ELLIS recruits fellows and students, and hosts visitors. By default, ELLIS positions are not associated with universities,
                            however, co-affiliations (e.g., as adjunct faculty) are encouraged.
                            <br/> Full-time appointments range from tenure-track positions right after the PhD
                            <sub>6</sub> all the way to director positions (comparable to full professor). All full-time employees
                            must have their main work location in an ELLIS institute, and they are encouraged to spend time
                            as visitors at other ELLIS institutes. For tenure track appointments, the tenure decision is
                            taken within four years after recruitment. Senior positions are immediately tenured, unless they
                            are secondments from other positions, in which case limited term contracts can be offered.
                            <br/> Part-time fellows are outstanding researchers whose main employment is outside ELLIS (and anywhere
                            in Europe), either in an academic or industrial lab, and who commit to spend at least one month
                            per year in an ELLIS institute. Part-time fellows are not tenured but they automatically get
                            renewed as long as the one-month annual residency requirement is satisfied. IP generated during
                            their residence at ELLIS generally falls under the same rules as IP generated by full time ELLIS
                            members, and all results are openly publishable. If part-time fellows are in parallel working
                            with their home institution, exceptions will be made for such projects, provided the fields of
                            work are transparently defined and delineated.
                            <br/> PhD or MSc students working at ELLIS get their degree from universities at one of the participating
                            sites. PhD students spend at least one year at one of the other ELLIS sites.
                            <br/> In addition, ELLIS hosts short- and long-term visitors. This includes the possibility of secondment,
                            during which researchers join ELLIS temporarily (paid either by ELLIS or their home institution).
                            We anticipate making heavy use of this at the beginning to help cold-start ELLIS.
                            <br/> ELLIS has an international advisory committee (AC) consisting of outstanding scholars in the
                            field who are not themselves members of ELLIS. ELLIS fellows and students are selected by means
                            of an international search process. For ELLIS fellows in any given country, the recruiting committee
                            consists of peer researchers located in other countries, the majority of which should be ELLIS
                            fellows (as well as, during the start-up phase, AC members). Since all candidates will thus be
                            evaluated by fellows located in other countries, this mechanism will ensure that the highest
                            quality standards are applied in recruiting. It will also ensure that no ELLIS fellow faces political
                            pressure from his national colleagues to be made an ELLIS fellow. The ELLIS initiative is open
                            to all researchers in Europe, but will hold everybody to a high bar. Since part-time fellows
                            can be located anywhere in Europe and sponsorship will be sought from the EU, we expect that
                            ELLIS will raise the level of excellence across all of Europe, having an effect akin to the outstanding
                            LMB (Learning in Machines and Brains) program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.

                            <br/> The host country pays for local ELLIS infrastructure and running costs. For the fellows' program
                            and studentships, we will seek funding from the EU, host countries, foundations, and industry
                            donations.

                            <br/> A number of European countries are current engaged in discussing ELLIS on a national level.
                            In addition, we are in contact with the EU.
                            <br/> We intend to convene a meeting of scientists as well as of high level decision makers soon,
                            possibly during the ICML conference (Stockholm, July 11-13) or ECCV (Munich, September 11-13).
