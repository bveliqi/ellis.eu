              full time and part time faculty, faculty seconded from their home institutions, visitors coming for shorter periods of time, \
              and PhD students. Involvement in ELLIS should not require (permanent) residence at an ELLIS site - indeed, we are hoping for \
              ELLIS to have an impact beyond its immediate locations."
